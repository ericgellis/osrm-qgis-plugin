**OSRM plugin for QGIS (UNMAINTAINED)**


Overview
========
Tiny `QGIS`_ plug-in allowing to retrieve and display data from an (ideally locally based) `OSRM`_ web service.

This plug-in is in its early stage of development and the code is hosted `on github`_.

**Only targets OSRM > v5.0 (API introduced around April 2016)**

Current plugin version : 0.1.0

Functionality
=============
- Find a route
- Get a time matrix
- Make accessibility isochrones
- Solve the Travelling Salesman Problem
- Compute and export many routes


Usage
=====
This plug-in is primarily aimed to be used on a local instance of OSRM.

If used to request the public API you have to adhere to the `API Usage Policy`_ (which include no heavy usage, like computing many `/viaroute` with this plug-in)

Example
=======
Images of this page are displayed on OpenStreetMap tiles (Â© OpenStreetMap contributors) and route computations were done with Open Source Routing Machine.

Find a route
------------
**Display a simple route from OSRM (with support of viapoints, alternatives roads and route instructions)**:

.. image:: help/source/img/route.jpg
   :scale: 10 %
   :alt: route illustration
   :align: center

Fetch a time-distance matrix
----------------------------
**Get a time matrix from one (or between two) QGIS point layer(s)**:

.. image:: help/source/img/table.jpg
   :scale: 10 %
   :alt: isochrone illustration
   :align: center

Compute accessibility isochrones
--------------------------------
**Compute monocentric or polycentric accessibility isochrones**:

.. image:: help/source/img/multi_isochrone.jpg
   :scale: 10 %
   :alt: isochrone illustration
   :align: center

Compute many *viaroute*
-----------------------
**Retrieve many routes between two QGIS layer of points**:

.. image:: help/source/img/many_routes.jpg
   :scale: 10 %
   :alt: isochrone illustration
   :align: center

Display the solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem
-------------------------------------------------------
**Display the result of the Travelling Salesman Problem computed by OSRM**:

.. image:: help/source/img/tsp.jpg
   :scale: 10 %
   :alt: isochrone illustration
   :align: center

Licence and attribution
=======================
If the information computed by this plugin is intend to be reused, you have to properly display the source of the routes and the data licence attribution :

- All the routes/time matrix displayed are computed by the underlying routing engine `OSRM`_.
- Route computed by the OSRM public API (and probably by your instance) rely on `OpenStreetMap`_ dataset which is under `ODbL`_.



Changelog
=========
0.0.1b:
     - Add support for new OSRM API (> v5.0) and drop support for other versions

0.0.1:
	- Add support for the OSRM `/trip` functionality
	- Add support for intermediate points in viaroute displaying.
	- Add experimental support for "polycentric" (and more precise) accessibility isochrones.
	- Add support for new OSRM rectangular matrix (and isochrones creation using it).
	- First release

0.0.1-rc1:
	- Drop the use of shapely for isochrone polygons construction.
	- ADD: a backport of functools.lru_cache to cache http request on client side.
	- ADD: restriction on the batch viaroute to prevent a massive use of the public API.
